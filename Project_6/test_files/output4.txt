For non-academic information that used to be included in the Catalog (before the Catalog became online only), please refer to Related Topics on the the Policies and Procedures page or go to the UA Homepage.
On many subjects, more detailed information is available from departments, colleges or administrative units responsible for various programs and things.  Students should seek information from these sources as needed.
The General Catalog is the University's primary, comprehensive single source of departmental, college and university-wide information related to academic programs. Courses, degree programs, and policies that govern progress towards completion of a degree are described in the Catalog. Students are responsible for knowing and understanding the carefully of the catalog they are following and are strongly encouraged to read the UA's student responsibility policy.
