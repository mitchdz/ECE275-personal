Description:

In this project, you will familiarize yourself with the use of unit tests, git, and structs. This project use a struct to model a purchasable item as an item type. This type has a name and a price.

You will implement the unit tests for this project and the actual functions themselves for the next project. To understand fully what the unit tests must do, you must also look at the requirements on the function implementations as well. 

Good luck!
