# Description: 
In this project you will be creating an application similar to that of Yelp. You will be using a structure to model the profile of a Business called a SporkProfile. This profile will include the businessâ€™ location, rating, and other properties. You will be supplied several files that contain information for several businesses. You will interpret these lines in the file and collect them in an array of Spork Profiles. Next, you will determine, among the profiles you gathered, which are appropriate businesses to show the user given their location and preferences. Finally, you will output the SporkProfiles to a file.
